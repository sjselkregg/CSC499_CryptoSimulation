# CSC499_CryptoSimulation
Simulated cryptocurrencies, possessing various reward schemes, will be interacted with by a population of crypto-miners to determine the reward scheme which provides the highest rate of miner participation.


Status: Need to finish including math/algorithms to make the simulation as realistic as possible. More specifically, everything is completed except for how many miners should be at which sensitivity level/ determining how much sensitivity levels come into play for decisions.(by Sunday)

All other math for costs(getting the exact cost for a specific mine from the base cost), how much of the population lives where (effects base cost), and coin value fluxuations have been completed.

A constantly updating coin value has been included to further promote realistic participation.

New class to represent a cryptocurrency object has been introduced...in progress. (Refactor)
